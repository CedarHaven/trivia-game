# Trivia-Game
This is a RWBY-based trivia game with six questions. It has a thirty-second timer on each question. For each question you answer, you will get a notification of if your answer was right or wrong; if you don't answer at all, you will get a 'ran out of time' message. Wrong answers and timeouts will also tell you what the correct answer was. At the end of the game, it will display the number of answers you got right, the number you got wrong, and the number of questions where you didn't give an answer, and then it will ask you if you want to play again.
